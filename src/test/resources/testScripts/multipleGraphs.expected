# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm for paths of
# two graphs

created graph simpleGraph
created graph secondGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph
added node C to secondGraph
added node D to secondGraph

added edge 10.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from C to D in secondGraph

path from A to B:
A to B with weight 10.000
total cost: 10.000

path from C to D:
C to D with weight 1.000
total cost: 1.000
