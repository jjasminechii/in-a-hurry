# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when
# there are two paths possible

created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph

added edge 3.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from A to B in simpleGraph

path from A to B:
A to B with weight 1.000
total cost: 1.000
