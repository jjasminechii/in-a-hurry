# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when
# there is no path found for a complex graph

created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph
added node C to simpleGraph
added node D to simpleGraph
added node E to simpleGraph

added edge 3.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from B to C in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from C to D in simpleGraph
added edge 3.000 from D to E in simpleGraph

path from E to A:
no path found
